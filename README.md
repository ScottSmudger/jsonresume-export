# GitHub Action for exporting JSONResume

This action exports your resume in [JSONResume](https://jsonresume.org/) to **HTML**.

This can be combined with other actions to publish your resume as a Github page.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| theme | JSONResume theme name. See https://jsonresume.org/themes/ | `flat` |
| resume_filepath | file path to your resume in JSONResume format | `resume.json` |
| output_filepath | output file path | `index.html` |

## Example Workflows

### To publish your resume as a Github page

> This example assumes you have a resume.json at the **root directory of your repository**. 

> In addition, this assumes you have set up your GitHub pages on this repository [to reference the `docs/` folder as your source](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source).

```yaml
# example GitHub workflow

name: Publish resume in JSONResume format as Github Page
 
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  check_run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "! contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[ci skip]')"
    steps:
      - run: echo "${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: check_run
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: scottsmudger/jsonresume-export@v1

        with:
          theme: macchiato
          resume_filepath: resume.json
          # modifies the index.html in-place
          output_filepath: docs/index.html
      - name: Commit published HTML
        id: commit
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain docs/index.html)" ]; then
            git add docs/index.html
            git commit -m "[ci skip] chore(docs/index.html): update resume page"
            echo ::set-output name=exit_code::0
          else
            echo ::set-output name=exit_code::1
          fi
      - name: Push changes
        uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master
        if: steps.commit.outputs.exit_code == 0
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          branch: ${{ github.ref }}
```

## Why?

Good question indeed!

In fact, you may already noticed JSONResume provides a [hassle-free hosting service to export and collate your resume already](https://jsonresume.org/getting-started/).

However, I made this action because:

1. Using a specific theme that is not supported [requires the JSONResume team to add the theme as dependency to their solutions](https://github.com/jsonresume/registry-functions/issues/7); I wanted to keep the export dependency lean with just the theme I need for my case.

2. This solution allow me to centrally keep a resume in both the JSON format as well as publishing it in HTML as a GitHub page easily.

3. I wanted to learn more about creating and writing Github Actions :robot:
